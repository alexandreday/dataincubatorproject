    <p>Figure 2: <br>
        Using geospatial information from Figure 1, we can determine the likelihood that
        a charging station is in the vicinity of a property with a certain valuation. 
        Here we plot the number of charging stations within a mile of all properties with
        a valuation under a specified value (x-axis, cost/square-feet). This emphasizes that weathly areas
        are generally much more likely to have a charging station nearby.
